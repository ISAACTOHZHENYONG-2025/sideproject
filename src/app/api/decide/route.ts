- "groups": one group per separate thing they want: a dish, cuisine, food type, or venue or brand name.
  "chinese rice" is two groups (chinese, rice); "chicken rice" is one dish, so one group. Empty when they named none.
  - "label": that thing in 1 to 3 words, spelled correctly, as the student meant it.
  - "terms": up to 10 lowercase words or short phrases that appear in a venue's name, cuisine, menu or serves list
    when it has that thing: the word itself, spelling variants, Malay, Chinese and English names, and specific dishes
    of that kind. Prefer words from the lists below. Examples: "bakuteh" -> ["bak kut teh", "肉骨茶"];
    "zus" -> ["zus", "zus coffee"]; "mcd" -> ["mcdonald"]; "noodles" -> ["noodle", "mee", "kuey teow", "laksa", "ramen"].
  - Keep terms specific to that thing. No broader words that many other venues share: not "rice" or "malay" for
    nasi lemak, not "teh" or "tea" for bak kut teh, not "coffee" for zus.
- Leave out words that don't describe food or place, such as "food", "near", "cheap", "now".
